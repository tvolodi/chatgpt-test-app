## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- AC-1: Hero is above the fold with logo asset (`/AI-Dala-logo.png` in `web/public`), tagline, subhead, and two CTAs: "Start with AI Dala" and "Join AI master-class".
- AC-2: Primary navigation includes links to About (`/about`), News (`/news`), Articles (`/articles`), Contact/Subscribe (`/contact`), and Sign in (`/signin`).
- AC-3: Sections are present and ordered: Hero -> What is AI-Dala? (short + link to About) -> For whom (pills/cards for entrepreneurs/devs/students) -> Latest articles (2-3 featured) -> AI News (latest 3-5) -> About project/author (Volodymyr) -> Contact/Subscribe/Telegram link.
- AC-4: Responsive layout across desktop/tablet/mobile; interactive targets are >=44px; cards/pills stack gracefully at smaller widths.
- AC-5: Rendered with SSG/ISR per ADR-0001; news/articles blocks revalidate on content updates or at least every 30 minutes (shared TTL 30m).
- AC-6: Initial view loads within 500ms p95 under normal conditions; images are optimized (compressed hero/logo, WebP/AVIF), and critical CSS is used.
- AC-7: SEO metadata set (title, description, canonical), Open Graph/Twitter tags, schema.org `WebSite` and `Organization/Person` (author) included.
- AC-8: Visual design follows AI-Dala branding (see `resources/Branding_Concept_AI_Dala.md`). Use: logo at `/AI-Dala-logo.png`; font stack `Inter, system-ui, sans-serif` (Lato/Poppins acceptable); palette Sky Blue `#3A9BDC`, Sand Beige `#E6C68E`, White `#FFFFFF`, Dark Gray `#2B2B2B`; spacing scale 4/8/12/16/24/32px; max content width 1200px; card/hero image aspect ratio target 16:9; maintain sufficient contrast.
- AC-9: Accessibility: semantic landmarks (header/nav/main/footer), visible focus states, aria-labels on nav/CTAs, alt text on images.
- AC-10: Content sources:
  - News (3-5 items) from `/api/content/news` with fields: `id`, `title`, `summary`, `url`, `image`, `published_at` (ISO8601). Provide placeholder fixtures for local dev.
  - Articles (2-3 items) from `/api/content/articles` with fields: `id`, `title`, `summary`, `url`, `image`, `updated_at` (ISO8601). Provide placeholder fixtures for local dev.
- AC-11: Dev fixtures are available for news/articles in the specified format to allow SSG/ISR hydration before the backend is live.

## 5. Non-Functional Constraints (for this REQ)

- Canonical URL: https://ai-dala.com/ (update if production domain differs).
- Schema.org type: `WebSite`, `Organization` (AI Dala, logo at `/AI-Dala-logo.png`, url canonical), `Person` (Volodymyr as author).
