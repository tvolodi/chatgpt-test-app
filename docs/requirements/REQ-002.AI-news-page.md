# VERSION: 0.4

## 1. Summary

- Title: AI News page
- Type: functional
- Priority: medium
- Status: approved

## 2. Description

User can browse an AI News listing with recent items, filter by category, and open individual news pages with share options.

## 3. User Story

- "As a visitor, I want to view recent AI news so I can stay informed about platform and industry updates."

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- AC-1: News list shows 10 most recent items by `published_at` desc; each item displays title, summary (excerpt), published date, and link.
- AC-2: Pagination uses "Load more" to fetch next 10 items until at least 30 items are available (page size 10).
- AC-3: Filters: category pills for OpenAI, Tools, Market, AI-Dala updates; default shows all. Filtering narrows list; pagination still applies to filtered results.
- AC-4: Rendering: ISR per ADR-0001 with revalidate TTL 30m; list pulls from `/api/content/news`.
- AC-5: Performance: list page p95 TTFB+render < 500ms under normal conditions (with ISR caching).
- AC-6: SEO list: title "AI-Dala News | Latest updates" and description "Stay current with AI-Dala updates, OpenAI news, tools, and market insights."; canonical `https://ai-dala.com/news`, OG/Twitter tags, schema.org `CollectionPage` with `ItemList`.
- AC-7: Accessibility: semantic landmarks (header/nav/main/footer), focus-visible, aria-labels for filters/pagination, alt text on images.
- AC-8: Branding: follow `resources/Branding_Concept_AI_Dala.md`; logo at `/AI-Dala-logo.png`.
- AC-9: Content source: `/api/content/news` returns at least 30 items with fields `id`, `slug`, `title`, `summary`, `body` (Markdown), `url`, `image`, `published_at` (ISO8601), `tags` (optional). List view uses `summary`; detail uses rendered `body`.
- AC-10: Individual news page at `/news/[slug]` shows title, published date, hero image (if available), rendered body from Markdown, and share buttons (Telegram, LinkedIn); uses branding and SEO (canonical `/news/[slug]`, OG/Twitter, schema `NewsArticle`). Slug must be unique, lowercase, hyphenated.
- AC-11: ISR for detail pages: revalidate 30m or on content update.
- AC-12: SEO detail template: title `"AI-Dala News | {title}"`, description `{summary}` truncated as needed; uses og/twitter image from `image` field when present.

## 5. Non-Functional Constraints

- Performance: p95 < 500ms for list and detail under normal conditions (assuming ISR).
- SEO: sitemap inclusion; canonical as above; structured data present.

## 6. SEO / AI Search Exposure

- In sitemap: yes (list and individual news pages).
- Canonical URL: https://ai-dala.com/news and per-article canonical at `/news/[slug]`.
- Schema.org: `CollectionPage`/`ItemList` for list; `NewsArticle` for detail.
- Crawlability: public and indexable; ensure proper canonical/robots.

## 7. Traceability

- Product Brief Feature(s): News (add in brief).
- Related Modules: MOD-FE-News (create), MOD-CMS/News source.
- Related Tests:
  - TC-UI-005 (list structure/ordering)
  - TC-UI-006 (filters + load more)
  - TC-UI-007 (SEO/structured data)
  - TC-UI-008 (detail + share + SEO)
  - TC-UI-009 (performance/ISR)

## 8. Notes for AI AGENTS

- Approve status once SEO copy is locked (see AC-6/AC-12).
- Keep rendering/caching choices aligned with ADR-0001 and document in module spec.
