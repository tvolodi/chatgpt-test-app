## 1. Summary

- Title: User Dashboard Layout
- Type: functional
- Priority: high
- Status: proposed

## 2. Description

The dashboard is the main authenticated user interface where users access AI-Dala features and content. It provides a consistent layout structure with header, sidebar navigation, main content area, and footer. The dashboard serves as the landing page after successful login and the hub for all authenticated user activities.

The design follows the AI-Dala branding concept with Sky Blue (#3A9BDC), Sand Beige (#E6C68E), and clean Inter typography.

### Color Usage
- **Header**: White background (#FFFFFF), Dark Gray text (#2B2B2B)
- **Sidebar**: Light background (#F7F9FC), Sky Blue active state (#3A9BDC)
- **Main Area**: Gradient background (#F7F9FC → #E8F4F8)
- **Footer**: Dark Gray background (#2B2B2B), White text (#FFFFFF)

### Spacing
- Header padding: 16px horizontal, 12px vertical
- Sidebar padding: 16px
- Main area padding: 24px
- Footer padding: 12px horizontal

### Typography
- Header logo: 18px, weight 700
- Sidebar links: 14px, weight 600
- Main content: 16px, weight 400
- Footer text: 13px, weight 400

## 8. Future Considerations

- Dark mode support
- Customizable sidebar (user can reorder/pin items)
- Breadcrumb navigation in main area
- Notification center in header
- Quick search in header

## 9. Notes

**Recommendation**: Create separate requirements for:
- **REQ-005**: Sidebar navigation items and structure
- **REQ-006**: User profile menu and settings
- **REQ-007**: Dashboard home page content (widgets, stats)

This keeps REQ-004 focused on layout structure while allowing detailed specifications for each component.
